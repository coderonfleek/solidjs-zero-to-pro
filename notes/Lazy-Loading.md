## Lazy Loading

* **What it is:** Lazy-loading routes in SolidJS is a technique where components for specific routes are only loaded when they are needed, rather than loading all components at the start of the application.
* **How It Works** : This is achieved by dynamically importing the components for a route only when that route is accessed. It reduces the initial load time and the amount of JavaScript needed to be downloaded when the app first loads.
* **Why Itâ€™s Useful** : Lazy-loading is especially beneficial for large applications with many routes, as it improves performance by loading smaller chunks of the application rather than the entire app at once.
