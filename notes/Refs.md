## Refs in SolidJS

- Refs in SolidJS are (short for references) special variables that hold a reference to a specific DOM element in your application, allowing direct access and manipulation of that element.
- They are particularly useful for cases where you need to perform tasks that cannot be done declaratively, such as focusing an input field, measuring element dimensions, or integrating with third-party DOM libraries
- This makes them an essential tool for more complex interactions and gives you fine-grained control over the DOM.
- To use refs in solid, you use the `ref` keyword and set itâ€™s value to that of the variable you have declared to reference it.
